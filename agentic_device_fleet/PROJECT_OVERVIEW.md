# Agentic Device Fleet Monitoring System - Project Overview

## Problem Statement

Organizations with large fleets of connected devices need intelligent ways to monitor device health, analyze trends, and gain insights from device status data. Traditional monitoring dashboards require technical expertise to create queries and interpret results. This system solves this by providing a conversational AI interface that understands natural language questions about device fleet health.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Concept

The system acts as an intelligent intermediary between users and device fleet data, using:
- **Natural Language Processing** to understand user intent
- **SQL Generation** to translate queries into executable statements
- **Data Analysis** to interpret results and provide insights
- **Conversational Interface** to deliver findings in human-readable format

### Key Capabilities

1. **Real-time Fleet Status Queries**
   - "How many devices are currently active?"
   - "Show me all inactive devices in the last hour"
   - "What's the current health distribution of my fleet?"

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - "What's the daily trend of dead devices this week?"
   - "Show me device failure patterns over the last month"
   - "Which locations have the highest device failure rates?"

3. **Predictive Insights**
   - Identify patterns in device failures
   - Highlight anomalies in device behavior
   - Suggest maintenance schedules based on trends

### Data Flow

```
Device Heartbeats → MSSQL → Kafka Events → Data Lake → Trino → AI Agent → User
```

## Technology Stack

- **AI/ML**: Large Language Models for query understanding and analysis
- **Data Lake**: Scalable storage for historical device data
- **Query Engine**: Trino for SQL analytics
- **Streaming**: Kafka for real-time event processing
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for structured AI interactions
- **Database**: MSSQL for operational data storage

## Business Value

- **Reduced MTTR**: Faster identification of device issues
- **Improved Operations**: Easy access to fleet insights without technical expertise
- **Proactive Maintenance**: Trend-based failure prediction
- **Cost Optimization**: Better resource allocation based on device health patterns
- **Scalability**: Handles growing device fleets without manual dashboard updates

## Success Metrics

- Query response time < 5 seconds for real-time data
- 95% accuracy in natural language query interpretation
- 90% user satisfaction with AI-generated insights
- 50% reduction in time-to-insight for fleet analysis
