# Distributed File System - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

This distributed file system (DFS) is designed to serve millions of concurrent users with a primary focus on storage efficiency and optimization. The system prioritizes high availability and read-after-write consistency for individual clients while allowing for eventual consistency across the global system.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Storage Efficiency First
- **Deduplication**: Content-based chunking and global deduplication
- **Compression**: Multi-level compression strategies
- **Erasure Coding**: Efficient redundancy with lower storage overhead than replication
- **Cold Storage Tiering**: Automatic migration to cheaper storage for infrequently accessed data

### 2. Scalability Targets
- Support for millions of concurrent users
- Horizontal scaling across thousands of nodes
- Petabyte-scale storage capacity
- Geographic distribution for global access

### 3. Consistency Model
- **Read-after-write consistency** for individual clients
- **Eventual consistency** for global operations
- Session affinity to ensure client sees their own writes
- Conflict resolution mechanisms for concurrent modifications

### 4. High Availability
- 99.99% uptime target
- No single point of failure
- Automatic failover and recovery
- Multi-region deployment support

## Core Components

### Storage Layer
- **Chunk Servers**: Store actual file data chunks
- **Metadata Servers**: Manage file system namespace and metadata
- **Deduplication Engine**: Content-based deduplication service
- **Compression Service**: Multi-tier compression optimization

### Management Layer
- **Master Coordinator**: Cluster management and coordination
- **Load Balancer**: Request routing and load distribution
- **Monitoring Service**: Health checks and performance metrics
- **Data Placement Service**: Optimal data distribution

### Client Interface
- **Gateway Servers**: Client-facing API endpoints
- **Cache Layer**: Multi-level caching for performance
- **Session Manager**: Client session tracking and affinity
- **Client Libraries**: SDKs for various programming languages

## Technology Stack

### Core Infrastructure
- **Storage Backend**: Custom storage engine with B+ tree indexing
- **Communication**: gRPC for inter-service communication
- **Coordination**: etcd for distributed coordination
- **Caching**: Redis for distributed caching
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Languages & Frameworks
- **Go**: Core system services (performance and concurrency)
- **Rust**: Storage engine and critical path components
- **Python**: Data processing and analytics
- **React**: Management dashboard
- **Docker + Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration

## Performance Targets

### Throughput
- 1M+ concurrent connections
- 100GB/s aggregate read throughput
- 50GB/s aggregate write throughput
- Sub-100ms latency for metadata operations

### Storage Efficiency
- 70%+ storage savings through deduplication
- 40%+ additional savings through compression
- 90%+ storage utilization efficiency
- 2x storage efficiency vs traditional replication

### Availability
- 99.99% uptime (52 minutes downtime/year)
- RPO: 1 hour (Recovery Point Objective)
- RTO: 15 minutes (Recovery Time Objective)
- Zero-downtime deployments

**Availability Cost Analysis:**
- 99.9% (8.76h downtime): 2x replication, basic monitoring
- 99.99% (52min downtime): 3x replication, advanced monitoring, multi-AZ
- 99.999% (5.26min downtime): 5x replication, real-time failover, 3+ regions
- Cost increases exponentially: 1x → 2.5x → 8x infrastructure costs

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Key management service integration

### Access Control
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect integration
- Audit logging for all operations

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance (data residency, right to deletion)
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare data
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
