# Photo Storage System

A highly scalable distributed system for storing and managing photos, similar to Google Photos.

## Overview

This system is designed to handle billions of photos with high availability, durability, and performance. The architecture focuses on horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient storage management.

## Key Features

- **Massive Scale**: Support for billions of photos and petabytes of storage
- **High Availability**: 99.99% uptime with global distribution
- **Fast Access**: Sub-second photo retrieval and thumbnail generation
- **Automatic Processing**: Real-time image processing, thumbnail generation, and metadata extraction
- **Search & Discovery**: AI-powered search capabilities and intelligent organization
- **Multi-device Sync**: Real-time synchronization across devices
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automatic backup with point-in-time recovery

## Architecture Components

1. **API Gateway & Load Balancer**
2. **Application Services**
3. **Metadata Management**
4. **Storage Layer**
5. **Processing Pipeline**
6. **Search & Indexing**
7. **Monitoring & Analytics**
