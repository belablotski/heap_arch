# Metrics Monitoring and Alerting System

A comprehensive monitoring and alerting system designed to handle large-scale infrastructure monitoring with 100M active users across 1000 pools x 100 servers.

## Overview

This system provides real-time metrics collection, storage, and alerting capabilities for distributed infrastructure monitoring.

### Key Features

- **Multi-tier data retention**: 7 days full resolution → 30 days 1-minute aggregation → 1 year hourly aggregation
- **Flexible collection methods**: Support for both push and pull metrics collection
- **Scalable architecture**: Kafka-based decoupling for high throughput
- **Multiple alert channels**: Email, phone, PagerDuty, webhooks
- **Time-series optimization**: Compression, encoding, and cold storage

## Architecture Components

1. **Data Collection Layer** - Pull and push-based metric collectors
2. **Message Queue** - Kafka for decoupling collection from storage
3. **Time-Series Database** - Optimized storage with multiple retention tiers
4. **Aggregation Engine** - Real-time and batch aggregation processing
5. **Alerting System** - Rule-based alerting with multiple notification channels
6. **Visualization** - Dashboards and query interfaces

## Quick Start

1. Review the [Architecture document](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for system overview
2. Follow the [Implementation Guide](./docs/implementation-guide.md) for setup
3. Configure data collection using [Collection Methods](./docs/collection-methods.md)
4. Set up alerting following [Alerting Design](./docs/alerting-design.md)

## Scale Requirements

- **Users**: 100M active users
- **Infrastructure**: 1000 pools × 100 servers = 100,000 servers
- **Data Retention**: 1 year with multi-tier resolution
- **Availability**: High availability with reliability focus
- **Latency**: Low-latency for real-time monitoring
